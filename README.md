# 🎬 Movie Search

A minimal and fast movie search application built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the **OMDb API**.  
Type to search — results appear instantly thanks to a debounced input. Movies are displayed in a clean responsive grid, and each card includes a button that opens a modal with full movie details.
